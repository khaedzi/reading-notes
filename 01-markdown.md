# Markdown 
* is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.**

# Examples

* It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com) 
# GitHub Flavored Markdown
* GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

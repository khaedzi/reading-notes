# Introduction

 
* Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty much like the GUI's on other systems that you are familiar with such as Windows and OSX. This tutorial won't focus on these as I reckon you can probably figure that part out by yourself. This tutorial will focus instead on the command line (also known as a terminal) running Bash.

Here's your first shortcut. When you enter commands, they are actually stored in a history. You can traverse this history using the up and down arrow keys. So don't bother re-typing out commands you have previously entered, you can usually just hit the up arrow a few times. You can also edit these commands using the left and right arrow keys to move the cursor where you want.


 

In this section, we'll learn the basics of moving around the system. Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system. As such, this stuff really forms the foundation of being able to work effectively in Linux. Make sure you understand it well.

So where are we? can use pwd  <br>

What's in Our Current Location? ls
<br>
Let's Move Around a Bit ? cd .
Relative path
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
Absolute path

file
obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
ls -a

Everything is a file under Linux
Even directories.

Files can have any extension they like or none at all.
Linux is case sensitive
Beware of silly typos.

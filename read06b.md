# i will till you about Hardware and Software and the computer how work ?

# Hardware and Software:
* A computer is an electronic machine that processes information—in other words, an information processor: it takes in raw information (or data) at one end, stores it until it’s ready to work on it, chews and crunches it for a bit, then spits out the results at the other end. All these processes have a name. Taking in information is called input, storing information is better known as memory (or storage), chewing information is also known as processing, and spitting out results is called output.
Software is a program that enables a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system (hardware).
By contrast, software is the set of instructions that can be stored and run by hardware. Hardware is so-termed because it is “hard” or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is “soft” because it is easy to change.
Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.
* The next layer, hardware , consists of the physical hardware of a computer system. Computer hardware includes devices such as gates and circuits, which control the flow of electricity in fundamental ways. This core electronic circuitry gives rise to specialized hardware components such as the computer’s central processing unit (CPU) and memory.

The programming layer deals with software, the instructions used to accomplish computations and manage data.

Every computer has an operating system (OS) to help manage the computer’s resources. Operating systems help us interact with the computer system and manage the way hardware devices, programs, and data interact.

# html 
* Hypertext Markup Language
is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

HTML uses Tags like html, head, body, h1 and many others in <>

the head tag is used to tell information about the page.
the body tag is for the main content of your web page.
the meta tag is to describe the page but it won't show for the user, it's only for searching the page on the internet.
to  create lists you can use the ordered list (ol) or the unordered list (ul) and use with them the li tag.
you can add images using img scr="" inside <>
there are section and article tags and they are used to help order the paragraphs.
many other tags are used, these are just a small sample from todays class

## I learned the following:
* Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users.
* Find out What Information Your Visitors Need and try to put this information.
* How Often People Will Visit Your Site, to make sure to keep updating your site**
* Wireframe is a simple sketch of each page of a site.
* Visual hierarchy, size, color, and style matters.
* HTML layouts, Header, Footer, navigation, articles, div, and sections.

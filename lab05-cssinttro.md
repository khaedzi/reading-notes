# CSS 

**css allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, you can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.**

## important things

* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

# CSS Selectors
There are many different types
of CSS selector that allow you to
target rules to specific elements
in an HTML document.

introduces the most commonly
used CSS selectors.
On this page, there is an HTML
file to demonstrate which
elements these CSS selectors
would apply to.
CSS selectors are case sensitive,
so they must match element
names and attribute values
exactly.

# color 
Color can really bring your pages to life.


color The color property allows you
to specify the color of text inside
an element. You can specify any
color in CSS in one of three ways:

## type of color :

green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.**

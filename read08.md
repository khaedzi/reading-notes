# Comparison operators.

A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values.

for examble:

Equal (==)
Not equal (!=)
Strict equal (===)
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal (>=)
Less than (<)
Less than or equal (<=)


## While and For Loops

Loops in general are used when you want certain commands to be executed multiple times until certain condition is achieved.

The difference between **while loops** and **for loops** can be illustrated by showing the syntax for both commnads:

### For Loops Syntax

```
for ("variable"="value 1";"variable" "comparsion operator" "value 2";"counter"){

    "the commands that you want them to be repeated";
}

for loop:
(var i; for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) { text += cars[i] + "
"; }

 while loop:
while (condition) 
{}
